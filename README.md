# Capstone Step One: Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Weather App with Astronomy Companion
This is my favorite idea. I would like to work with weather, astronomy, and/or map APIs.
### Summary:
App with one-page weather-app-style display of reports for the user's local weather and also some astronomical data reports. Features could include: live local weather status and forecast, moon phase tracking, cloud coverage report, constellation report with star visibility rating and reports of upcoming astronomical events like eclipses and meteor showers.
### Problem: 
Weather apps tend to make astronomical data a second priority, if they show it at all, which can make it a hassle to plan for stargazing. They also lack certain features that would be convenient for those who make a hobby of enjoying the night sky.
### Solution: 
Bringing together reports for both terrestrial and astronimcal weather, this app would show not only local weather reporting but also astronomical tracking. A one-stop-all for astronomy hobbiest and everyday use alike.
### APIs:
I could use OpenWeatherMap API for all the weather data. There are a few free astronomy APIs I have looked at, but I have not narrowed one down which provides the data I would need.

## Idea 2: Roadtrip Roulette
### Summary: 
App to offer roadtrip reroutes based on user preferences for activities/sites along the way. (Ex. user inputs their desired- and starting-locations and the app provides 1: the fastest route with "on-the-way" activity/site suggestions (or none) as a baseline for comparison, and 2: a selection of other possible routes that visit different sites/attractions complete with the total time it would add compared to the fastest route. All of the recommended stops tailored to user interests; potentially a questionaire on account setup for things like "Do you prefer mountains or beach? Do you prefer national parks or amusement parks?..."
### Problem: 
Roadtrips can be boring and planning a fun roadtrip with activities along the way can be quite time consuming.
### Solution: 
This app would make planning a roadtrip easy and fun. It would connect users with routes that not only get them to their destination, but also provides fun stops along the way tailored to their interests.

## Idea 3: Trail Finder App with Weather Companion
### Summary: 
App to locate nearby hiking trails while also gathering a weather report for the area so that hikers can make more informed decisions about where to hike. Features include warnings to not hike areas that are experiencing poor weather conditions, best times to hike for best weather and gear/equipment recommendations for preparedness.
### Problem: 
It can be hard to find the best hikes when weather is unpredictable, making it even more difficult for hikers to stay prepared and make informed decisions about when and where to hike. Informed decisions also include whether or not it is safe and what equipment may be best suited for the terrain/conditions. 
### Solution: 
An app to generate local hiking trails and also a local weather reporting for each trail so that hikers can make real-time comparisons of trails to make the most informed decisions! Find the best hikes for cloudy days or sunny days, or see an alert to avoid certain trails if their local winds speeds are too high or weather is otherwise hazardous. Also recommend safe alternative hikes if the weather is hazardous for others.
